As a challenge project to myself, I set out to develop a {\itshape single} dynamical system + controller simulator class that had the following properties (note this becomes somehwat trivial if you allow different \mbox{\hyperlink{classSimulator}{Simulator}} classes for specific settings)\+:

1) Allowed the user to choose what kind of object they used to represent vectors/matrices, 2) Allowed the user to swap out different dynamic functions, controllers, and disturbance generating processes, 3) Allowed the user to specify linear or nonlinear dynamics.

To meet satisfy property 1, I used templates; to satisfy properties 2 and 3 I allowed the user to pass in function pointers to generate dynamics, control actions and disturbances to the simulator.

The resulting simulator relies structs of parameters used by different simulator template realizations.

I\textquotesingle{}ve also implemented a \mbox{\hyperlink{classMPC}{M\+PC}} solver using Cpp\+AD and Ip\+Opt that has a quadratic cost, L\+TI dynamics, and polytopic state and input constraints. Although Ip\+Opt and Cpp\+AD is a bit overkill given everything is a QP, I plan to eventually implement a nonlinear \mbox{\hyperlink{classMPC}{M\+PC}} controller as well, and to keep things simple I wanted to rely on a single optimization backend.

File list as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{Simulator_8h_source}{Simulator.\+h}}\+: contains the Simulator$<$\+Vec,\+Params$>$ template, and its implementation
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{Parameters_8h_source}{Parameters.\+h}}\+: contains struct definitions for parameters needed by a simulator implementing L\+TI dynamics, and a simulator implementing an \mbox{\hyperlink{classMPC}{M\+PC}} controller
\item \mbox{\hyperlink{MPC_8h_source}{M\+P\+C.\+h}} and M\+P\+C.\+cpp\+: my custom \mbox{\hyperlink{classMPC}{M\+PC}} controller
\item main.\+cpp\+: simple program to test out everything
\item plot\+\_\+traces.\+py\+: call python plot\+\_\+traces.\+py to generate a matplotlib plot of state and control trajectories generated by main.\+cpp
\item $\ast$.tr\+: contains output of simulation
\end{DoxyItemize}

Then there are files specifying C\+Make options, and the correspondingly generated Makefile and other files. Note that the C\+Makelist.\+txt and the \mbox{\hyperlink{classMPC}{M\+PC}} code skeleton (at a very superficial level) were adapted from Udacity\textquotesingle{}s self-\/driving car \mbox{\hyperlink{classMPC}{M\+PC}} project.
